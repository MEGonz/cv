         <p>So we used cellspacing to add 20% of spacing around everything. The spacing is expressed in terms of a percentage</p>

         <i>This is the italic type HTML attribute.</i>
         <br>
         <em> The em tag it really is better way to code to get
           emphasis on what I am writing...it really does look better.</em>
         <em>The strong tag is better than bold.</em>
         <br>
         <strong>Better than just BOLD or <b>bold</b>. The Strong tag really ephasisies the way my code is supposed to look</strong>
         <br>
         <p>Ok so the task is to write something that explains who I am and what I am about.
           <br>I am broke and I am learning this stupid shit because I need to find a way to support myself
           <br>No one is going to do it for me so I am working really hard.</p>
         <br>Now I am learning to write tables and moving this text from beneth the image to the side of the image is considered intermediate HTML.
         <br>What is really interesting is that if I type text outside of the Table structure it appears at the top of the page above the image. Isnt that fun?
